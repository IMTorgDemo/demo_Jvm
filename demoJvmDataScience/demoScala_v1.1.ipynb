    "# Review of Alternative JVM Workflows for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "JVM-based languages, Java in particular, are popular tools for enterprise and web app systems, such as Java Spring.  Introducing a data science pipeline with these systems offers many alternatives.  In this document, we focus on jvm-language data science workflows that integrate closely with these environments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach might be to use more traditional data science tools (R or Python) in a MicroService.  While this is often a strong, isolated approach, it can lead to inflexibility in team dynamics, and difficult in data transferability when the functionality in question is considered a core component of the underlying system."

    "Really impressive polygot environments.  Transformation of the Beaker notebook (formerly Jupyter competitor) which makes use of the strengths of many languages.  Fun demo, [here](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/twosigma-beakerx-f82v308h/notebooks/StartHere.ipynb).  Also, SciJava project has goal of being a polyglot kernel for Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "_History lesson:_ Beaker notebooks offered multiple languages, with shared data structures (specifically dataframes), within the same notebook - awesome!  Doing this in Jupyter (R2Py) is difficult and doesn't work so well.  And it was supported by a profitable firm.  But, it was never accepted by the open-source community, and never had contributors (such as through extensions), and was eventually disbanded.  This could be caused by a variety of reasons: late to market, less publicity.  But, overall, I think data science doesn't value multiple language use, or interoperability.  Focusing on multiple languages detracts from advancements in math and algorithmic implementation.\n",
