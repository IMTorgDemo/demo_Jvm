The following is the workflow for implementing the decision engine formulations:

* _Sarah_
* document math in confluence

* _Jason_
* code math in jupyter
* run simulations, document results
* document decisions made during analysis
* export code to _NAME.scala_

* _Alex_
* move _NAME_.scala into _cyber_ repo directory
* run tests to complete process
